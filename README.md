# menti-bot
**A unofficial Client/Bot for the Menti / Mentimeter interactive presentations.**

## Current state
This project is in a very early stage of development and is not professional at all, feel free to contribute to make my bad code so much better!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
    - Modules: requests, _thread, time, (json) - should all be available by default

## Availability
This was initially intended to be run on linux, but most probably would also work on any other system which supports Python 3.x

## Usage
Download the ZIP package and unpack it somewhere
In terminal/cmd:

> cd /path/to/your/extracted/zip
>
> python3 menti.py 

In case that doesn't work try using just "python" instead of "python3"
